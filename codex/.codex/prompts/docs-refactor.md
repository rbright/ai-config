description: Restructure README into a clear table of contents and consolidate scattered docs.
---

## Implementation

1. Discover
   - Audit `README.md` and any other docs for length, duplication, and gaps.

2. Plan structure
   - Design a concise README table of contents with anchors and links.
   - Decide what stays in `README.md` vs. what moves to focused files.

3. Refactor
   - Reorganize sections, deduplicate content, and add missing cross‑links.
   - Link to key prompts under `codex/.codex/prompts/` where helpful.

4. Verify
   - Ensure examples build/run; fix broken links.

## Boundaries

- Consolidate; avoid creating large new doc trees.
