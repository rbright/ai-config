description: Update project docs to match current code, architecture, and workflows.

## Implementation

1. Inventory and plan
   - Identify authoritative docs (e.g., `README.md`, component overviews, architecture notes).
   - Create a short checklist in `TASKS.md` under "Docs Update" with concrete items.

2. Update core docs
   - Refresh `README.md`: quick start, commands, project layout, key scripts.
   - Sync component and business‑logic descriptions with current implementation.
   - Update or add Mermaid diagrams where they clarify architecture or flows.

3. Validate
   - Cross‑check examples and commands by running them.
   - Remove stale or duplicate content.

## Boundaries

- Documentation only; do not change behavior.
- Prefer updating existing docs over adding new trees.
