description: Refactor AGENTS.md and related instruction files to remove duplication and improve readability.

## Implementation

1. Discover
   - Locate root `AGENTS.md` and any imported rule files (e.g., `.ai/instructions/`).

2. Analyze
   - Identify duplicated guidance and unclear groupings.

3. Restructure
   - Create a clear hierarchy (general → domain‑specific).
   - Consolidate duplicates; cross‑link instead of repeating.

4. Validate
   - Ensure no rules lost; fix references and links.

## Boundaries

- Do not change the intent of rules—structure only.
