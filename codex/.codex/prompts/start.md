description: Start executing the plan in TASKS.md with context from REQUIREMENTS.md.
---

## Implementation

1. Load context
   - Read `REQUIREMENTS.md` for scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
   - Read `TASKS.md` to identify next unblocked items.

2. Execute work
   - Begin with the highest‑priority unblocked tasks in "Next Up".
   - Update `TASKS.md` as you progress: mark status, add notes, record blockers and follow‑ups.

3. Keep momentum
   - When a dependency clears, immediately pull the next item forward.
   - Surface risks or scope gaps back into `REQUIREMENTS.md` (Assumptions/Risks) and add mitigation tasks.

## Boundaries

- Coordinate and update the plan; avoid unrelated code changes unless the task explicitly calls for them.
