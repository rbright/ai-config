# user-git-pr

Create a GitHub pull request following the Conventional Commits standard with automated analysis of changes.

## Implementation

1. **Analyze the current branch and changes**:
   - Run `git branch --show-current` to get current branch name
   - Run `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline` to see commits
   - Run `git diff origin/main --name-only` to see all changed files
   - Run `git diff origin/main --stat` to see change statistics
   - Determine the scope and type of changes

2. **Determine the change type based on modifications**:
   - **feat**: New features or functionality
   - **fix**: Bug fixes or corrections
   - **docs**: Documentation only changes
   - **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
   - **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
   - **test**: Adding or updating tests
   - **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, configuration
   - **perf**: Performance improvements
   - **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes

3. **Analyze commit patterns**:
   - Review commit messages for consistency
   - Check if commits follow conventional format
   - Identify the primary change type across commits
   - Determine appropriate scope from file paths

4. **Generate PR title using Conventional Commits format**:
   - Format: `type(scope): description`
   - Scope is optional and represents the affected area
   - Description should be clear and concise
   - Use imperative mood (e.g., "add" not "adds")

5. **Create comprehensive PR body**:
   - **Summary**: What changes were made and why
   - **Test Plan**: How the changes were tested
   - **Related Issues**: Link to issue tracker if applicable
   - **Breaking Changes**: Note if applicable
   - Include Claude Code attribution

6. **Execute GitHub CLI to create the PR**:
   - Use `gh pr create` with generated title and body
   - Set appropriate labels based on change type
   - Add reviewers if configured
   - Set draft status if changes are incomplete

## Example Usage

```sh
User: /user-git-pr
Assistant: I'll analyze your changes and create a pull request following Conventional Commits standards.
