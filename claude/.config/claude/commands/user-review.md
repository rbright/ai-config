# user-review

Deploy QA, Code Reviewer, and Security Engineer sub-agents to comprehensively review the implementation, then synthesize their findings into actionable tasks for implementation agents.

## Implementation

1. **Preparation Phase**:
   - Read requirements.md to understand acceptance criteria
   - Check root tasks.md to identify active implementation agents
   - Run git diff to identify all modified files
   - Prepare context for review agents

2. **Deploy Review Sub-Agents in Parallel**:
   
   **QA Sub-Agent**:
   - Task: Test functionality against requirements.md
   - Create test report in `.claude/tasks/qa-tasks.md`
   - Identify missing functionality, defects, and integration issues
   - Verify acceptance criteria are met
   
   **Code Reviewer Sub-Agent**:
   - Task: Review code quality and logic
   - Create review report in `.claude/tasks/code-reviewer-tasks.md`
   - Identify logic bugs, performance issues, architectural concerns
   - Check adherence to CLAUDE.md conventions
   
   **Security Engineer Sub-Agent**:
   - Task: Scan for security vulnerabilities
   - Create security report in `.claude/tasks/security-engineer-tasks.md`
   - Identify credential exposure, injection risks, access control issues
   - Review cryptography and data protection

3. **Synthesis Phase**:
   - Collect all findings from review agents
   - Categorize issues by severity and responsible agent
   - Create remediation tasks for each implementation agent

4. **Task Creation**:
   Update implementation agent task lists with remediation tasks:
   - Backend Engineer: API fixes, logic corrections, performance improvements
   - Frontend Engineer: UI bugs, accessibility issues, state management fixes
   - Infrastructure Engineer: Security hardening, monitoring gaps
   - Data Engineer: Data quality issues, pipeline failures
   - ML Engineer: Model performance issues, training problems

5. **Priority Assignment**:
   - Critical: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks
   - High: Functional defects, performance problems
   - Medium: Code quality issues, missing tests
   - Low: Style issues, minor improvements

# Review Checklist for [Feature Name]

## Task Completion Verification

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ
- [x] Task 1.1: Set up WebSocket infrastructure
  - ‚úÖ WebSocket endpoint created and tested
  - ‚úÖ Connection handling implemented
  - ‚úÖ Authentication middleware functional
  - **Review**: Code follows established patterns

- [x] Task 1.2: Create event listener service
  - ‚úÖ Event subscription working
  - ‚úÖ Event filtering implemented correctly
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è  Error handling could be more robust
  - **Review**: Consider adding circuit breaker

### Phase 2: Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] Task 2.1: Frontend WebSocket client
  - ‚úÖ Connection established successfully
  - ‚úÖ Reconnection logic tested
  - ‚úÖ Message handlers comprehensive
  - **Review**: Good error recovery patterns

### Phase 3: Production Readiness ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [x] Task 3.1: Error handling and recovery
  - ‚úÖ Circuit breaker implemented
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è  Retry logic needs exponential backoff
  - ‚úÖ Fallback mechanisms in place
  - **Review**: Address retry timing issue

## Technical Decision Validation
- ‚úÖ WebSockets implemented as specified
- ‚úÖ JWT auth in connection params working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Redis pub/sub not yet configured for scaling

## Success Criteria Assessment
- [x] Real-time updates < 100ms (avg: 45ms) ‚úÖ
- [x] Supports 1000+ connections (tested: 1200) ‚úÖ
- [ ] 99.9% uptime (monitoring not yet configured) ‚ùå
- [x] Zero message loss during reconnects ‚úÖ

## Code Review Findings

### Critical Issues (0)
None found.

### High Priority (1)
1. Redis pub/sub configuration missing for multi-instance support

### Medium Priority (2)
1. Exponential backoff needed in retry logic
2. Complex function in WebSocketManager (needs refactoring)

### Low Priority (3)
1. Missing TypeScript types in 3 functions
2. Consider rate limiting on connection endpoint
3. Add metrics collection for monitoring

```

## Notes

- Deploys QA, Code Reviewer, and Security Engineer sub-agents
- Each agent creates their own report in their task list
- Findings are synthesized into tasks for implementation agents
- Only creates tasks for active agents (from root tasks.md)
- Prioritizes issues by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Review agents have read-only access (cannot modify code)
- Creates actionable remediation tasks, not just findings
- Integrates with distributed task management system
